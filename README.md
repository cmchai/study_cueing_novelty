# This is the offcial repository of the Cueing Novelty Study

In this study, we explored the extent to which people can engage in flexible task preparation based on the information regarding the novelty of the incoming task

## Aim of this repository

This repository was created to openly share the scripts that I created for the computer-based experiment, as well as the scripts used in data analysis. Thus, I only included scripts, and not stimuli used in the experiment. For the word stimuli used in our experiments \(in both English and Dutch\), please go to [our repository](https://osf.io/fstn6/) on Open Science Framework (OSF).

## Structure of this repository

The experiment scripts \(mostly in Javascript and html\) were organized based on the experiment number \(1-3\). Since they are online experiments, thus they have to be hosted on a webserver.
the analyis scripts were mainly in R and in need of R and RStudio installed on your local computer. we have also conducted a meta-analysis after combining datasets across experiments.

## Bugs and improvement

if you run into issues when running this script, or your think something can be improved, please contact the author \(chaimengqiao@\[gmail\].com\)
